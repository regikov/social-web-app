# Social Network Management System
## **Project Overview:** <br>
The Social Network Management System is a web application designed to manage users, set status messages, and connect users as friendsâ€”all within a local environment, without relying on external APIs. This application provides a platform where users can view and interact with a feed of status updates from themselves and their friends.

## **Key Features**
**1. User Management** <br> 
User Creation: Add new users, complete with a name, profile picture, and other relevant details. <br>
Status Updates: Set and update status messages for individual users. <br> <br>
**2. Friend Management:** <br> 
Friend Connections: Allow users to connect with other users by adding them as friends using their unique IDs. <br>
Status Feed: Display a unified feed where users can view their own and their friends' status updates. <br> <br>
**3. Feed Display** <br> 
Feed Page: A dedicated feed page (Feed.tsx) where status messages are displayed in visually appealing cards. <br>
Filter by User: Enable filtering of the feed by a specific user's ID to see status updates from that user and their friends. <br> <br>
**4. Styling and UI** <br> 
User Cards: Design and implement cards to display user information such as name, status message, and profile picture. <br>
Responsive Design: Ensure the application is fully responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.  

## **Milestone Structure**
